# Goals and Constraints

Rebalancer lets you express what you want from an assignment as **goals** and
**constraints**, built from a library of 25+ reusable specs. Some specs work only as
a goal, some only as a constraint, and many as either.

- A **constraint** defines what makes an assignment valid; it must hold.
- A **goal** is a quantity to minimize; with several goals, their relative
  priority decides how they trade off.

To add them to the solver, use `addConstraint` and `addGoal`. Only the spec is
required; the remaining parameters are optional:

```cpp
solver.addConstraint(spec, policy, invalidCost, invalidState, tuplePosIfBroken);
solver.addGoal(spec, weight, tuplePos);
```

- For a constraint, `policy` and the `invalidCost` / `invalidState` /
  `tuplePosIfBroken` tuning control its [constraint policy](constraint-policy):
  how a constraint that is already broken in the initial assignment is treated
  (fixed best-effort by default, or made strictly hard or soft).
- For a goal, `weight` and `tuplePos` control its [goal priorities](goal-priorities):
  how it trades off against other goals.

## Available specs

Where a spec has its own page, its name links to it. The **Type** column shows
whether a spec can be used as a goal, a constraint, or either. **Examples** links
to the spec's unit tests.
