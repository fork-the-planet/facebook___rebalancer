# AvoidAssignments

**Type**: Constraint

Forbid specific objects from being placed on specific scope items. For example,
keep certain tasks off certain hosts (say, because those hosts lack hardware the
task needs).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | No | `""` | Descriptive name for logging/debugging. |
| `scope` | string | Yes | - | The scope the listed scope items belong to (e.g. `"host"`). |
| `assignments` | list of [AvoidAssignment](#avoidassignment-entries) | Yes | empty | The forbidden (object, scope item) pairs. |

### AvoidAssignment entries

Each `AvoidAssignment` forbids one object from a set of scope items:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `object` | string | The object being restricted |
| `scopeItems` | list of string | The scope items this object may not be placed on |

## Example

An example use: tasks on hosts, where certain tasks may not go on certain hosts.
Forbid `t0` from `h0` and `h1`, `t1` from `h0` and `h2`, and `t2` from `h0`.

```cpp
solver.setObjectName("task");
solver.setContainerName("host");

solver.setAssignment(std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>{
    {"h0", {"t0", "t1"}},
    {"h1", {"t2"}},
    {"h2", {"t3"}},
});

auto forbid = [](std::string object, std::vector<std::string> scopeItems) {
  AvoidAssignment entry;
  entry.object() = std::move(object);
  entry.scopeItems() = std::move(scopeItems);
  return entry;
};

AvoidAssignmentsSpec avoidSpec;
avoidSpec.scope() = "host";
avoidSpec.assignments() = {
    forbid("t0", {"h0", "h1"}),
    forbid("t1", {"h0", "h2"}),
    forbid("t2", {"h0"}),
};
solver.addConstraint(avoidSpec);
```

`t0` and `t1` both start on `h0`, which is forbidden for both, so they move: `t0` to
`h2` (its only allowed host) and `t1` to `h1`. `t2` is already on an allowed host
(`h1`) and stays. `t3` is unconstrained.

## Constraint only

AvoidAssignmentsSpec cannot be used as a goal; passing it to `addGoal` throws.

If the initial assignment already respects every forbidden pair, so does the final
one. If an object starts on a scope item it is forbidden from, that pair is
initially broken, and the general [constraint policy](../constraint-policy) takes
over: under the default policy Rebalancer moves the offending objects off as best
it can without breaking constraints that held initially.

## Avoiding many pairs

Listing every pair gets unwieldy when a large share of objects must be kept off a
scope item. An equivalent formulation scales better: add a dynamic object
dimension (`addDynamicObjectDimension`) that is 1 for each disallowed (scope item,
object) placement and 0 otherwise, choosing the `defaultValue` (0 or 1) that
leaves fewer explicit entries. Then add a [CapacitySpec](capacity) on it with an
`ABSOLUTE` `MAX` limit of 0, so no disallowed placement fits.
